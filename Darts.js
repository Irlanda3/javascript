/*Instructions
Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

Darts is a game where players throw darts to a target.

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards with 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.
The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (This is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered to the same point (That is, the circles are concentric) defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its real cartesian coordinates x and y), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing in that point.*/



function calculateDartPoints(x, y) {
  // Calculate the distance from the origin (0, 0)
  const distance = Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2);

  // Check which circle the dart landed in and assign points accordingly
  if (distance <= 1) {
    return 10;
  } else if (distance <= 5) {
    return 5;
  } else if (distance <= 10) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const xCoordinate = 3;
const yCoordinate = 4;
const points = calculateDartPoints(xCoordinate, yCoordinate);
console.log(`Points earned: ${points}`);
